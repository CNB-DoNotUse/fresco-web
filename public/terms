The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.

The notice must include the following information:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);

Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Service should be sent to Fresco News, Inc., 494 Broadway 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10012 (support@fresconews.com).

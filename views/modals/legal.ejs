			    <strong>
			        CONTENT SHARED THROUGH THE SERVICE
			        <br/>
			    </strong>
			    The Service may make it possible for you to choose to share certain information with the public. There are a number of ways in which you can control how
			    much information is shared with the public, and we will make efforts to comply with your instructions from the options provided to you. You understand that
			    by designating information to be shared through the Service, you may be revealing information that you choose to share. You understand and acknowledge that
			    you are fully aware and responsible for the impact of sharing such materials, and you agree that we shall not be held responsible, and we shall be released
			    and held harmless by you from any liability or damages arising out of such conduct. <strong></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    <strong>
			        CONTENT REQUESTS, PAYMENTS; ARCHIVE
			        <br/>
			    </strong>
			    <u>Requests</u>
			    . The Service permits certain publishers, as such publishers are more fully identified in the Service and as agreed between such publishers and Fresco
			    (“Publishers”) to request submissions of Content (“Requests”) from users (“Producers” or “you”); and, if the Publisher so desires, to purchase a license to
			    use the Content submitted in response to the Request. Requests will specify the sum (net of Fresco’s commission) to be paid to the Producer (the “Request
			    Fee”) upon the acceptance of the Content by the Publisher, as well as other details, within the Request, including but not limited to, title, caption,
			    “Assignment Expiration Time,” “Option Minimum Time Period,” “Exclusive License Period,”<strong> </strong>geographic location and radius.
			</p>
			<p>
			    You agree that the designation of Publishers under this Agreement may be established by Fresco and such third-party publishers on a case by case basis. For
			    example, a Publisher may sometimes be a television station or a newspaper, or may be a broader umbrella media organization.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Exclusive “First Look” to Purchase</u>
			    . As a user, you may submit Content in response to Requests prior to the Assignment Expiration Time, which may be adjusted by Fresco. If you do, the
			    Publisher receiving the submission will have an <em>exclusive</em> option to purchase an exclusive license in the Content for a period of time, which may
			    vary. For a single Publisher Request, the period of time of the <em>exclusive</em> option to purchase a license will begin upon submission of the Content
			    and will continue until the later of (i) the Assignment Expiration Time, or (ii) the time the Content was submitted, plus the Option Minimum Time Period
			    (the “Option Period”). For single Publisher listings, if the Publisher does not elect to purchase a license to the Content during the Option Period, the
			    Content will automatically be made available in the Archive. during the Option Period, the Producer may not sell, license, or permit any other entity to
			    use the Content.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>The Consolidated Listings</u>
			    . From time to time, we may combine multiple similar Requests into a consolidated listing (each a “Consolidated Listing”), for example, in the event that
			    multiple Publishers post Requests relating to the same event. For a Consolidated Listing, you may only submit Content to one Publisher at a time. If you
			    submit Content to a specific Publisher in a Consolidated Listing, that Publisher will then have an <em>exclusive</em> option, during the Option Period to
			    purchase an <em>exclusive </em>Solicited Publisher Content License for that Content during the Exclusive License Period. If the Content is not licensed by
			    the first Publisher you submit to in the Consolidated Listing, the Content may be offered for licensing to other eligible Publishers in the Consolidated
			    Listing under the terms of this paragraph. If none of the Publishers participating in the Consolidated Listing elect to purchase a license to the Content
			    before the expiration of all applicable Option Periods, the Content will automatically be made available in the Archive (as defined below).
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Solicited Publisher Content License</u>
			    . A Publisher is under no obligation to accept any Content you submit in response to a Request (whether in a single listing or a Consolidated Listing), but
			    if it does (i) you will be paid the Request Fee through the Service, and (ii) you automatically, without additional action required, grant a Solicited
			    Publisher Content License (as defined herein) to the Publisher, as further described in the section entitled LICENSE FACILITATED TO PUBLISHERS. Fresco will
			    pay the Request Fee to you, after receipt from Publisher.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Archive</u>
			    . Fresco may make an area of the Service available for you to publish your Content for viewing and potential licensing by certain Publishers, known as “the
			    Archive.” Content you submit in response to Requests may automatically be made available in the Archive upon (i) expiration of the Option Period(s) (if no
			    Publishers elect to purchase a Solicited Publisher Content License license), or (ii) the expiration of the Exclusive License Period, if applicable. The
			    Service may also permit you to make unsolicited Content available in the Archive. By making your Content available in the Archive, you are offering an
			    Archive Publisher Content License in the Content to certain Publishers for a standard fee set by Fresco from time to time (the “Archive Fee”). If a
			    Publisher accepts your offer to license your Content from the Archive, you automatically grant the Archive Publisher Content License to the Publisher for
			    that Content. Fresco will pay the Archive Fee, net Fresco’s commission, to you after received from the Publisher.
			</p>
			<p>
			    You may remove any of your Content from the Archive at any time; however, any Publisher Content Licenses granted before your removal will remain in effect.
			    You may not remove Content from responses to Requests after you have submitted it for potential license purchase.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Payment Processor</u>
			    . We may use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill and remit payments through an online account for use of the Services. The
			    processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not
			    responsible for error by the Payment Processor. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or
			    received payment. Once a Publisher has made payment to Fresco or its authorized Payment Processor, the Publisher shall have no further liability for
			    payment to the Producer.

			    herein by reference.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above description may be adjusted or amended by Fresco from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <strong>LICENSES FACILITATED TO PUBLISHERS</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Solicited Publisher Content License</u>
			    . If a Publisher purchases a license in Content submitted in response to a Request (whether an individual Request or a Consolidated Listing), you thereby
			    automatically

			        GRANT TO THE PUBLISHER A, PERPETUAL, IRREVOCABLE, NON-SUB-LICENSABLE AND NON-TRANSFERRABLE (EXCEPT TO AFFILIATES AS DESCRIBED HEREIN), WORLDWIDE, FULLY
			        PAID-UP, ROYALTY FREE RIGHT AND LICENSE TO
			    </strong>
			    <strong>
			        REPRODUCE, USE, MODIFY, DISPLAY, PERFORM, DISTRIBUTE, TRANSLATE AND CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS FROM ANY SUCH CONTENT, IN ANY AND ALL MEDIA, WHETHER NOW
			        KNOWN OR HEREAFTER DEVISED, BY ANY AND ALL MEANS OR TECHNOLOGIES, WHETHER NOW KNOWN OR HEREAFTER DEVISED, IN ALL LANGUAGES, THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE AND
			        IN PERPETUITY, ALL WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS, LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND
			    </strong>
			    (the foregoing being the “Solicited Publisher Content License”). The Solicited Publisher Content License is <em>exclusive</em> to the purchasing Publisher
			worldwide during the applicable Exclusive License Period.<strong><u>THIS MEANS YOU MAY NOT PERMIT ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, WHETHER ON THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE, TO USE THAT CONTENT DURING THE </u></strong>    <strong><u>EXCLUSIVE LICENSE PERIOD</u></strong>. After the Exclusive License Period expires, Publisher(s) shall retain the Solicited Publisher Content
			    License on a non-exclusive basis, and you may license the Content to others on a non-exclusive basis over the Service or otherwise.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Archive Publisher Content License</u>
			    . If a Publisher purchases a license in Content offered through the Archive, you thereby automatically
			    <strong>
			        GRANT TO THE PUBLISHER, A PERPETUAL, IRREVOCABLE, NON-SUB-LICENSABLE AND NON-TRANSFERRABLE (EXCEPT TO AFFILIATES AS DESCRIBED HEREIN), WORLDWIDE, FULLY
			        PAID UP, ROYALTY FREE RIGHT AND LICENSE TO

			    <strong>
			        REPRODUCE, USE, MODIFY, DISPLAY, PERFORM, DISTRIBUTE, TRANSLATE AND CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS FROM ANY SUCH CONTENT, IN ANY AND ALL MEDIA, WHETHER NOW
			        KNOWN OR HEREAFTER DEVISED, BY ANY AND ALL MEANS OR TECHNOLOGIES, WHETHER NOW KNOWN OR HEREAFTER DEVISED, IN ALL LANGUAGES, THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE AND
			        IN PERPETUITY, ALL WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS, LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND
			    </strong>
			    (the foregoing being the “Archive Publisher Content License” and together with the “Solicited Publisher Content License, the “Publisher Content License”).
			    <strong>
			        The Archive Publisher Content License is non-exclusive, such that you may grant concurrent licenses in the Content to multiple entities, over the
			        Service or otherwise.
			    </strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Attribution/Right to Edit</u>
			    . As a condition to the Publisher Content License, unless otherwise instructed by Fresco in Fresco’s sole discretion (which you grant Fresco the right to
			    do on your behalf), Publishers shall give reasonably prominent authorship attribution to you in all uses of the Content. You understand that the Publisher
			    may amend, change, distort and otherwise modify the Content after the purchase of the Publisher Content License. Other than the attribution as stated
			    herein, you waive any and all moral rights in your Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, through functionality of the Service, you may opt-out of
			    attribution when submitting Content.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Affiliates</u>
			    . Publishers may transfer and/or sub-license Content that they license to (i) any entity that they control, (ii) any entity that controls them, or (iii)
			    any entity under common control with them (each an “Affiliate”). To “control” means owning or otherwise controlling 50% or more of the voting securities or
			    rights of an entity, or otherwise having the power to dictate its activities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <u>Promises and Responsibilities</u>
			    . You understand and agree that you are a direct licensor to the Publisher. Although Fresco may facilitate the Publisher Content Licenses through the
			    Service, you understand and agree that Fresco is not granting this license to the Publisher – you are doing so directly. As the Producer, you represent and
			    warrant to Fresco and the Publisher that (a) you are the sole owner of the rights herein granted to Publisher; (b) you have the right to enter into and
			    perform this Agreement; (c) no consents, authorizations, or releases need to be obtained from any third parties, and no payments need to be made to any
			    third parties for the use of the Content; and (d) that the use of the Content as provided herein will not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third
			    parties. In addition to that which is provided to Fresco herein, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Publishers to whom you grant licenses through
			    the Services, and all those claiming under or through such Publishers, from any claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses, including
			    reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, which may result from any breach or alleged breach by you of your representations and warranties hereunder.
			    Publishers shall be considered third-party beneficiaries to this provision of the Agreement.

			    members, employees and agents harmless from all allegations, judgments, awards, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including but not limited to

			    <strong>DISPUTES, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    You agree that any claim or dispute between us arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Service or any service provided by us, will be
			    resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
			    qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The laws of the State of New York shall govern this Agreement,
			    and shall be used in any arbitration proceeding.
			</p>
			<p>
			    There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
			    same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a
			    court would.
			</p>
			<p>
			    To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the following address: Fresco News, Inc., 85
			    Broad St. #17.134, New York, NY 10004.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Arbitration under this Agreement will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules then in effect. Payment of all filing,
			    administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
			</p>
			<p>
			    You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
			    If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, both you agree that parties have each waived any right to a jury trial.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property or other
			    proprietary rights, or for defense and indemnification as provided for herein.
			</p>
			<p>
			    To the extent arbitrations does not apply, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to the Services, or to us, may only be brought by you, and
			    may be brought by us, in a state or federal court located in New York, New York. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS VENUE AS INCONVENIENT OR
			    INAPPROPRIATE, AND AGREE TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN NEW YORK.

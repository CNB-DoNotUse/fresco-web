            <p>Using only an iPhone, you can be a part of the news revolution with Fresco! In the same way that Uber has made it easier to hail a ride, Fresco is helping news organizations get raw content from the scenes of various news events.</p>

            <p>Although anyone with our app can respond to assignments or submit news content organically, we are enlisting the help of Fresco Pro Users in order to ensure everything goes smoothly. Thats where you come in!</p>

            <p>We need users who are extremely flexible and willing to be on call for us.</p>

            <p class="last">Being on call means that for every assignment you answer, you are guaranteed $50, whether a news stations purchases your content or not! In addition to this, we will be paying guaranteed shifts for Nightcrawlers willing to help us ensure coverage between the hours of 12am-8am, for $50 a shift, even if you don’t get any content purchased.</p>
